Example-Code-1
==============

Messing around with pointers and std::vectors.  Was used as experimentation for giving game objects different attributes through components.  Essentially the idea was this:  You start with a base object and you add different components like "Graphics" or "Physics" that get updated every time the base object gets updated.  Was just messing around with the idea.
